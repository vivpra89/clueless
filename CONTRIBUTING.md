- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:
- A clear and descriptive title
- A detailed description of the proposed enhancement
- An explanation of why this enhancement would be useful
- Examples of how it would work

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these issues:
- `good first issue` - issues which should only require a few lines of code
- `help wanted` - issues which need extra attention

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clueless.git
   cd clueless
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   composer install
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

4. **Set up databases:**
   ```bash
   touch database/database.sqlite
   touch database/nativephp.sqlite
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan migrate --database=nativephp
   ```

5. **Add your API keys to `.env`:**
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
   NATIVEPHP_APP_ID=com.yourcompany.yourapp
   ```

6. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   composer dev
   ```

## 🔐 Code Signing & Security

### For Contributors (Development)

**You don't need Apple Developer certificates for contributing!** The project automatically creates unsigned builds for development, which are perfect for testing your changes.

If you see warnings like this, it's completely normal:
```
⚠️  No code signing certificate found - creating unsigned build
💡 To create signed builds, install an Apple Developer certificate in Keychain
```

### Security Guidelines

**❌ NEVER commit these:**
- `.env` file with real credentials
- Certificate files (`.cer`, `.p12`)
- Apple Developer credentials
- Real API keys

**✅ SAFE to commit:**
- `.env.example` (template only)
- Source code
- Build scripts (auto-detect certificates)
- Documentation

### Before Committing

Always verify no sensitive data:
```bash
git status
git diff --cached
grep -r "your-actual-api-key" . --exclude-dir=vendor
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before submitting:**
   - Run `npm run format` to format your code
   - Run `npm run lint` to check for linting errors
   - Run `php artisan pint` for PHP code style
   - Run `composer test` to ensure all tests pass

2. **PR Title:**
   - Use conventional commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
   - Example: `feat: add export functionality for transcripts`

3. **PR Description:**
   - Reference the issue being fixed: `Fixes #123`
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - List any breaking changes

4. **Review Process:**
   - PRs require at least one review before merging
   - Address all review comments
   - Keep PRs focused - one feature/fix per PR

## Coding Standards
